# Cryptocurrency Alerting and Notification System

This project is a **front-end application** for a cryptocurrency alerting and notification system. The system allows users to receive real-time alerts about cryptocurrency price changes and percentage changes through **email** and **phone notifications**. 

The front-end interacts seamlessly with the back-end, which handles the logic for alert conditions and sending notifications.

## Features
- **Real-time Alerts**: Users can define price thresholds or percentage changes for various cryptocurrencies.
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Alerts are sent via both email and SMS/phone notifications.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using a modern front-end framework for seamless interaction.
- **Easy API Integration**: Communicates with the back-end system to fetch cryptocurrency data and manage alert preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end Framework**: React.js (or Vue.js/Angular if preferred)
- **API Integration**: Axios (or Fetch API) is used to interact with cryptocurrency data APIs and back-end services.
- **Notifications**: Integrates with third-party services (such as Twilio or SendGrid) for email and SMS notifications.
